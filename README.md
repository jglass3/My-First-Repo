Using Github as my personal portfolio to document numerous scripts that I have made or scripts that I have found and modified.
Script may be in either in Python, VBA, JavaScript (Google App or Excel Online), and SQL when applicable.

Docs beginning with JS are my JavaScript (Google App Script) that I have personally developed over time.

Docs beginning with VBA are my maros written for my excel projects/files

Docs beginning with Py and SQL are my templates that I created walking through tutorials online.
